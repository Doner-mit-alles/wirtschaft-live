Other materials, such as the game board and packaging, are recyclable or made from recycled materials.\n</p>\n<p>\nAdditionally, we investigate the pollution of the Ilmenau River (which flows through Lüneburg) by collecting and counting plastic waste.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor this website, we collaborate with the Lüneburg-based IT company \"webnetz\" and the IT specialist trainees in their third year of training from the IT22B class at our school.\n</p>"
